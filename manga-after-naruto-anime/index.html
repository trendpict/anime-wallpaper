<h3 id="the-series-would-also-spawn-multiple-anime-series-movies-novels-video-games-and-more">The series would also spawn multiple anime series, movies, novels, video games and more.</h3><p>After shippuden episode 53, when naruto, sakura, sai and yamato returned to the village. Naruto part 1 anime was really good (skip all filler after 135 ofc) shippuden was pretty bad, many parts are quite unwatchable with the filler and pacing (also the story in part 2 had a lot of issues but that�s more of kishimoto�s fault). In the manga, naruto sneaks into the hokage residence to steal the scroll of seals and is caught by hiruzen sarutobi, but escapes by using sexy technique. After watching the final battle between naruto and sasuke and the naruto uzumaki episode, i stopped watching the series because i thought it was over. The first fight back at around episode 153. Now, twelve years later, naruto is a member of the ninja academy;</p>
