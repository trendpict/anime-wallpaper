<p>A great pair of glasses is like a rug — it can really tie the room together! This character is from the 1985 anime series robotech, back when anime defiantly still had more bad examples of black girl anime characters than good ones. Search over 100,000 characters using visible traits like hair color, eye color, hair length, age, and gender on anime characters database. I hate anime characters with glasses. These characters don’t just look smart, they look good too! Aiden Walkinson Anime guys with glasses, Anime guys.</p>
