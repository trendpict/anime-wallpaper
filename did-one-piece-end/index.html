<p>The dubbing of new anime lessened and 4Kids announced on December 6 2006 that they had canceled production of their One Piece dub and dropped the license. Since episode 279 the One Piece anime doesnt have ending songs. Obviously the ending of One Piece is drawing near. Out of the Big Four manga Naruto One Piece Bleach and Fairy Tail all have ended except for One Piece Boruto Naruto Next Generations isnt the original Naruto series. One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda has revealed that the story for the long running manga is now in its final stageWith where the Wano Country arc has taken things for Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hat pirates the end of the series has seemed like it was much closer now than it.

<p>This article details the events that happened with Hinati Fujinami who had been diagnosed with lung cancer. Ultimately 4kids produced 104 English-dubbed episodes from the first 143 Japanese episodes. Thankfully he told his wife how he wants the rest of the story to play out and end but I think that if he passes away or he cant finish it then the ending. In my opinion for One Piece will end in 4 years is GREAT. Luffy a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after.
