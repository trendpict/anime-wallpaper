<p>One Piece stylized in all caps is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro OdaIt has been serialized in Shueishas shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997 with its individual chapters compiled into 100 tankōbon volumes as of September 2021The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Jello on October 23 2015. If you remember at the end of the Whitebeard War Newgate says to BB youre not the one Rogers looking for so my guess is One Piece has huge significance to the Void Century and the Will of D and Roger placed it there so that only someone who carried his will and the will of all the Ds before him would be able to reach Raftel and obtain One Piece he only didnt do it himself bc he was already. Fans have been speculating the One Piece ending as soon as the 100th Volume of the manga series will be available. I dont think he meant it in the sense that hell change the entire outcome.
