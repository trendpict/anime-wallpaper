<p>Some of the qualifying factors taken into consideration for a series being deemed great are, entertainment value, popularity, lasting appeal, quality of writing, originality and significance to the medium of anime. Create lists for what you�ve seen &amp; read, watch over 40,000 legal streaming episodes online, and meet other anime fans just like you. Category containing players, staff, and other characters. I actually think the anime characters really have a place in the series, i mean, kaz (angsty hero), jun (purity sue), were probably the first anime characters that come to mind but nina, anna and lee have never been too different.

<p>All out isn�t your typical anime. Keeping this in mind, it must be said that vegeta certainly deserves to be among the elite when it comes to the discussion of power. Category containing players, staff, and other characters. I mean, her name is in the title so we really should have seen this one coming. Whether it be the best looking, more intriguing, or most badass character, anime as a medium is one that is often defined by its most popular characters.
