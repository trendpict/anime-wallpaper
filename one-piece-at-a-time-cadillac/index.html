<p>My Johnny Cash albums includes a humorous 1 rockabilly song One Piece at at Time recorded in 1976 and written by Wayne Kemp. Fasteners and other small parts find their out the door in his lunch box while larger components are hidden in the partners motor home. It tells a story from the point of view of a Detroit auto worker who watches Cadillacs roll by day after day on the assembly line all the while knowing that he will never be able to afford one on his salary. This song was the last song performed by Cash to reach number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and the last of Cashs songs to reach. In my case it was one maybe 4 or 5 pieces at a time from the junkyard in a 1947 Hudson Commodore or a 1941 Diamond T 5-ton-capacity cattle truck. Pin On Photographs.</p>

<p>But instead of a fan-made tribute he decided that his creation would be a gift to Johnny Cash. Well I left Kentucky back in 49An went to Detroit workin on a sembly lineThe first year they had meputtin wheels on cadillacsEvery day Id watch them b. The song is the story of a Cadillac assembly line worker watching Cadillacs roll by and knowing that he will never be able to afford one on his salary. He and a co-worker decide to build their own Cadillac by removing one piece at a time from the factory. Discussion in The Hokey Ass Message Board started by haring Oct 5 2003. Pin On Car Car Car.</p>
