<p>Odas plans place the ending of the One Piece manga around 2025-2026 though fans should note that this is no reliable indication of exactly when the anime - at one point the fourteenth most popular TV show in the world and consistently in the top five rated animated shows in Japan -. The author Eiichiro Oda himself stated in Volume 42 chapter 405 Originally my plan was that One. While Oda doesnt write much romance I do think Sanji and Nami will end up together. He has claimed so far that Luffy is going to die but how does he know that. Luffy and his crew of The Straw Hat Pirates with their search for a forgotten treasure called One Piece at the end of the Grand Line As fans eagerly await the answer to just how long Oda plans on continuing there are a lot of discussions on when One Piece will end.

<p>He could travel. The series now with 20 years under its belt and counting has captured the hearts and souls of die-hards and newbies alike. I would estimate its going to end at epiode 1200-1300. So that kid knew how Oda plans to end the manga too before he died. Sanji will have found the All Blue by the end of One Piece but Namis dream is a bit more complicated.

<p>This is no different for One Pieces creator Eiichiro Oda who only sleeps 3 hours a night and has just one day off a week. If you ask me I am now more concerned by how it will end rather than when. The end of the manga One Piece is an enigmatic one even to fans who were with Monkey D. The End of One Piece At the end of One Piece Robyns dream will be accomplished when she reaches Raftel Frankies dream accomplished by making a ship that surpasses all other ships and Namis dream of navigating the world will also be accomplished and reads the Rio Poneglyph learning the true history of the Void Century. The One Piece end is comingeventually. One Piece Creator Gives Update On Manga And When It Will End One Piece Manga One Piece Episodes Anime One.</p>
