<p>The anime adaptation produced by Toei Animation of the series saw the light of day very soon thereafter in 1998 and so far there have been over 900 episodes of the One Piece anime.

It would be better to end on a high note than a dimly low one. This explains why Oda keeps trying to end One Piece as soon as possible and he even already had the ending in mind.

<p>Long-running manga One Piece by Eiichiro Oda might be nearing the end of its voyage in the near future. 18 years after it first appeared in comic form creator Eiichiro Odas One Piece is more popular than ever. So One Piece isnt probably gonna end for another year or two. Original words from Oda mid 2019 was that he wanted to end it within 5 years. One Pieces latest Wano Arc still shows style and details of the country that is cut-off from the World Government and the rest of the world.
